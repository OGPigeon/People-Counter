# People-Counter
It does what the name says it does man. It counts people.

# Methode
By using YOLOv4, which is a real-time object detection model published in April 2020 that achieved state-of-the-art performance on the COCO dataset. It works by breaking the object detection task into two pieces, regression to identify object positioning via bounding boxes and classification to determine the object's class. This implementation of YoloV4 uses the Darknet framework.

By using YOLOv4, we are implementing many of the past research contributions in the YOLO family along with a series of new contributions unique to YOLOv4 including new features: WRC, CSP, CmBN, SAT, Mish activation, Mosaic data augmentation, CmBN, DropBlock regularization, and CIoU loss. In short, with YOLOv4, you're using a better object detection network architecture and new data augmentation techniques.
